PDF Core Font Information
=========================

This package contains PDF font information files downloaded from
http://www.adobe.com/devnet/font/#pcfi and elsewhere. See the individual
files and the summary below for related copyright and licensing information.

Any Adobe patents covering information in these files should be included in
the patent pledge they have made to ISO for the PDF 1.7 standard. Here's what
Adobe legal wrote when asked about this:

    "Adobe has provided a patent pledge to ISO which states that Adobe will
    grant a fee and royalty free license to an unrestricted number of
    applicants on a worldwide, non-discriminatory basis and under other
    reasonable terms and conditions to make, use, and sell implementations
    of PDF 1.7 (ISO 32000-1)."
    (private communication to Jukka Zitting, 2008-12-03)
